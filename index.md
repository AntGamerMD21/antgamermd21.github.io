# 📚 eval-guide - Master ML Evaluation Metrics Easily

[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Visit%20Releases-brightgreen)](https://github.com/AntGamerMD21/eval-guide/releases)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to **eval-guide**! This project offers beginner-friendly Jupyter notebooks to help you learn about machine learning evaluation metrics. You will explore concepts like accuracy, F1 score, RMSE, ROC/AUC, and more. Each notebook comes pre-run with outputs, so you can see the results immediately. The content is designed for anyone new to machine learning.

## 💻 System Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you should have:

- A computer with **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**.
- **Python 3.6** or higher installed. 
- The **Jupyter Notebook** application. You can download it using pip:

  ```
  pip install notebook
  ```

- Internet access for downloading the notebooks and data files.

## 📁 Download & Install

To download **eval-guide**, visit the releases page linked below. 

[Download eval-guide](https://github.com/AntGamerMD21/eval-guide/releases)

Once there, look for the latest release. Download the Jupyter notebooks and extract the files if they are compressed.

## 📔 Contents

Inside **eval-guide**, you will find several Jupyter notebooks covering various topics in machine learning:

1. **Introduction to Evaluation Metrics**: Understand why metrics matter in machine learning.
2. **Accuracy & Precision**: Learn how to calculate these metrics and when to use them.
3. **F1 Score Explained**: Discover how to balance precision and recall.
4. **Understanding RMSE**: Get to grips with root mean square error and its significance.
5. **ROC and AUC**: Delve into the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and its area under the curve.
6. **Cross-Validation Techniques**: Explore ways to validate your model's performance.
7. **Challenge Exercises**: Put your knowledge to the test with real-world examples.

## 🏁 Running the Notebooks

1. After downloading, navigate to the **eval-guide** folder.
2. Open your command line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal).
3. Run the following command to start Jupyter:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. A new tab will open in your default web browser, showing your files. Click on the notebook you want to run.
5. Follow the instructions in each notebook to explore the concepts.

## 🤖 Notebook Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Modify code and see the results instantly.
- **Visuals**: Each notebook includes charts, graphs, and plots to enhance your understanding.
- **Analogies**: We use simple analogies to explain complex concepts.
- **Pre-Computed Outputs**: Each notebook has outputs filled in, so you can focus on learning, not running code.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By completing the **eval-guide** notebooks, you will:

- Be comfortable with key evaluation metrics in machine learning.
- Understand how to apply these metrics to real-world projects.
- Gain hands-on experience with Jupyter notebooks.
- Enhance your data science knowledge and skills.
